O(n) attention is deception. Shared kernel for non-transformer predictive descendants.

`decepticons` extracts reusable model mechanisms from a broader
experiment family so downstream systems can specialize without forking the
kernel itself.

## What It Does

`decepticons` provides the mechanism layer:

- reusable substrates and memory primitives
- controller summaries, gates, routing, and modulation
- reusable readout and feature-view building blocks
- lightweight runtime and evaluation helpers
- backend-neutral family metadata and deterministic substrate builders, such as
  `decepticons.causal_bank`
- export helpers and contracts for descendant systems

It is intentionally not a full runtime system:

- no fleet orchestration
- no benchmark-specific policy
- no packed-artifact economics
- no external evidence or audit packaging

That work belongs in descendants such as `chronohorn`.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Quick start:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
python3 examples/quickstart.py
```

## CLI

```bash
opc fit --input ./corpus.txt --prompt "predictive " --generate 80
```

## Python

```python
from decepticons import ByteCodec, ByteLatentPredictiveCoder

text = "predictive coding likes repeated structure.\n" * 64
model = ByteLatentPredictiveCoder()
fit_report = model.fit(text)

prompt = ByteCodec.encode_text("predictive ")
sample = model.generate(prompt, steps=40, greedy=True)

print(fit_report.train_bits_per_byte)
print(ByteCodec.decode_text(sample))
```

## Architecture

The intended ecosystem split is:

```text
decepticons -> chronohorn -> heinrich
kernel                 runtime       evidence / audit
```

Ownership is simple:

- `decepticons`
  - family-neutral predictive mechanisms
  - reusable substrate, memory, control, and readout primitives
  - backend-neutral family metadata
  - export ABI helpers
- `chronohorn`
  - training, replay, scoring, fleet execution, and runtime observation
- `heinrich`
  - external validation, evidence packaging, and audit compression

## Kernel Boundary

What belongs in the kernel:

- substrate dynamics
- predictive and exact-context memory primitives
- controller summaries, gating, routing, and modulation
- reusable readouts and feature views
- lightweight runtime and evaluation helpers
- export-friendly deterministic family/config surfaces

What does not belong in the kernel:

- one descendant's training recipe
- one descendant's artifact format
- one descendant's leaderboard or frontier story
- one descendant's legality or audit policy
- one descendant's fleet/runtime orchestration

If a mechanism can be named without reference to a specific descendant and used
unchanged by more than one downstream system, it belongs here. Otherwise it
stays in the descendant.

## Modules

  - feature and summary views
- `readouts`, `experts`
  - reusable readout surfaces (now includes GRU recurrent readout)
- `causal_bank`

## Scope

This is a research kernel and reference implementation.

It is not:

- a frontier runtime system
- a production compression stack
- a benchmark claim
- a complete reproduction of every descendant in the broader workspace

It exists to keep the shared mechanism layer reusable and legible.
