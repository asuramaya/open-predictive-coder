# Kernel Matrix

This matrix lays out the kernel-first build order for `decepticons` using three sources of guidance:

- the upstream workspace thesis that the reusable center is the literal core from which the downstream systems evolve
- the generalized downstream pattern language in [`downstream_patterns.md`](./downstream_patterns.md)
- the research anchors in [`related_work.md`](./related_work.md)

The point is not to preserve every historical branch name. The point is to extract the smallest reusable kernel from
the upstream workspace that can still support causal, noncausal, oracle, bridge, and byte-latent downstream systems.

This matrix is written against the current kernel, including the recent shared-contract wave:

- a family-neutral noncausal adapter
- a paired teacher/export contract above the shared bridge layer
- a generic artifact-boundary audit helper

Use [`lineage.md`](./lineage.md) for the attribution rule behind the upstream workspace paths named below.
Use [`frontier_pass.md`](./frontier_pass.md) for the current descendant-frontier read across the live sibling repos.

## Source Anchors

### Upstream Workspace

- `README.md#L8` in the upstream workspace:
  the working thesis is a rich substrate plus a learned side-channel and readout
- `README.md#L21` in the upstream workspace:
  the live fixed-substrate thread is hierarchical and multi-timescale
- `README.md#L29` in the upstream workspace:
  the harness is meant to compare substrate designs, not just masks
- `ORIGIN.md#L15` in the upstream workspace:
  the original design language was subtraction, predictive coding, and a reservoir plus controller plus readout stack

### Generalized downstream framing

- [`downstream_patterns.md`](./downstream_patterns.md):
  the kernel should be organized as substrate dynamics, side-channels, views, readouts, and runtime
- [`downstream_patterns.md`](./downstream_patterns.md):
  causal systems need legality, replay, and packed-artifact discipline
- [`downstream_patterns.md`](./downstream_patterns.md):
  noncausal systems need field selectors, replay, and side-data accounting
- [`downstream_patterns.md`](./downstream_patterns.md):
  oracle systems need analysis-only context and attack accounting
- [`downstream_patterns.md`](./downstream_patterns.md):
  bridge systems need explicit runtime contracts

### Research anchors

- [`related_work.md`](./related_work.md):
  predictive coding implies local residuals and error-carrying views
- [`related_work.md`](./related_work.md):
  reservoir computing anchors the fixed-substrate side of the kernel
- [`related_work.md`](./related_work.md):
  rate-distortion and information bottleneck thinking justify explicit latent commits
- [`related_work.md`](./related_work.md):
  sequence predictive coding and continual modeling motivate the runtime and rollout surfaces
- [`related_work.md`](./related_work.md):
  recurrent refinement and byte-level latent compression motivate the byte-latent adapter layer

## Priority

### P0: finish the remaining kernel spine

- integrate the new modulation and predictive-surprise primitives into more than one descendant before widening them further
- richer exact-context expert families beyond the current exact-history memory core
- full training harness and optimizer-facing loop extraction beyond the current eval/transfer scaffold
- tighter hierarchy/controller integration beyond pooled predictive views and the compact predictive-surprise primitive

### P1: finish the causal kernel contract

- rollout evaluation
- replay-safe reporting
- packed-artifact and legality hooks
- broader memory-first expert/cache interfaces beyond the current statistical backoff layer

### P2: grow sideways into noncausal and bridge work

- noncausal field selectors and replay accounting
- oracle analysis helpers
- bridge/export schemas
- payload-choice helpers and teacher-export surfaces once they repeat across multiple descendants

### P3: only then stabilize presets

- named preset bundles copied from the upstream workspace
- compatibility aliases for historical branch names if still useful

## Current Read

The kernel is no longer just an echo-state toy. It now has:

- fixed recurrent substrate
- delay substrate
- linear memory substrate
- oscillatory memory substrate
- mixed-memory substrate
- hierarchical multiscale substrate
- substrate factory and `substrate_kind` dispatch
- controller-summary contract
- predictive controller primitive plus compact predictive/surprise primitive
- learned boundary-scoring and learned segmenter primitive
- pathway-gate primitive
- summary router primitive
- hormone modulation primitive
- exact-context memory and support-weighted blending primitives
- smoothed n-gram memory primitive
- fitted statistical backoff layer over order-wise n-gram priors
- shared cache-view wrappers over exact-context and statistical-backoff prediction records
- feature-view primitives for both byte-latent and hierarchical state
- bridge feature utilities over probability arrays
- family-neutral probability diagnostics over probability arrays
- bidirectional context analysis primitive
- scored-span selection primitive
- local byte encoder, patch pooler, and learned global-to-local bridge primitives
- deterministic sampled multiscale readout
- reusable linear-memory feature view
- reporting runtime surface
- lightweight rollout and next-step evaluation
- weighted dataset eval, rollout curves, and transfer probes
- frozen readout expert primitive
- first shared causal adapter
- first shared oracle-analysis adapter
- first shared bridge-export adapter
- byte-latent adapter
- example-project smoke surfaces for the hierarchical ancestor path and early exact-context repair builds
- causal mixture/correction/repair replica projects built from primitives
- bridge proxy-feature and feature-export consumers built from primitives
- a first shared noncausal reconstruction adapter
- a first shared paired teacher/export contract
- a first generic artifact-boundary audit helper over artifact accounting

The line to preserve is:

- if a mechanism is required by multiple descendants, it belongs here
- if a choice is really a downstream task policy, legality rule, artifact boundary, or evaluation claim, it does not
  belong here

That is why the upstream workspace remains the main source anchor even now that `src/` contains both `byte-latent`
and a first `causal_predictive` adapter. The line still matters: descendants can thin around the causal contract
without forcing descendant-specific policy back into the kernel.

That is enough to justify continuing kernel-first rather than inventing downstream codenames too early.
